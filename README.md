# KeebLink - The market-overview app for the custom keyboard scene

Created by **Paul Fischerl√§nder aka Keebify** in November 2021.

Built with React and Airtable to make easy adjustments to the core catalog.

Easy upkeep of all of the data by using a tight integration of the **Airtable API**


**This is an outdated and abandoned project**


## 

Core features of [KeebLink](https://keeb.link):

### `Easy stock overview`

KeebLink is built so that it is easy to keep track of all of the available switches, keycaps and keyboard kits out there.\
When I first started with this hobby it was pretty confusing with the amount of different kind of types of keyboard parts.

With KeebLink you can see the whole majority of essential keyboard parts available by vendors.\
You can easily sort them by for example Linear or Tactile variants of a switch, or sort by layout if you are looking for ISO keycaps.

### `Guides for newcomers`

KeebLink provides you with a lot of own guides and links to different sites, so you can get started enjoying this hobby quicker.

**You wanna learn how to properly lube your switches?**\
We got you.

**You want to learn how to design and built your own PCB and Case?**\
We've got a link for that.

### `Compatibility Checker for your selected parts - COMING SOON`

Most of the time, there should be no issues with your selected parts, as they are mostly all standardized.

Tho some things, like using a north-facing PCB with Cherry keycaps can cause interference issues.
The `Compatibility Checker` will look out for these kind of problematic situations and inform you if necessary.

### `Vendors list for all regions`

Finding Vendors in your area can be sometimes difficult, especially for newbies. KeebLink therefore lists a majority\
of vendors for different regions so you can choose the right vendor without having to deal with possible customs problems\
or long delivery times.


### `Known issues and bugs`

 - When pressing "show all" in selection, the selected items don't reset
 - Submit Button doesn't work
 - Outdated database
 - Some items can overflow
