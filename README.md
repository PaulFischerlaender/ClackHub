## 

Core features of [ClackHub](https://clackhub.com/index).:

### `Easy stock overview`

ClackHub is built so that it is easy to keep track of all of the available switches, keycaps and keyboard kits out there.\
When I firsted started with this Hobby it was pretty confusing with amount of different kind of types of keyboard parts.

With ClackHub you can see the whole majority of essential keyboard parts available by vendors.\
You can easily sort them by for example Linear or Tactile variants of a switch, or sort by layout if you are looking for ISO keycaps.

### `Guides for newcomers`

ClackHub provides you with a lot of own guides and links to different sites, so you can get started enjoying this hobby\
more quicker.

### `Compatibility Checker for your selected parts`

Most of the time, there should be no issue with your selected parts, as they are mostly all standardized.\

Tho some things, like using a north-facing PCB with Cherry keycaps can cause interference issues.
The `Compatibility Checker` will look out for these kind of problematic situations and inform you if necessary.

### `Vendors list for all regions`

Finding Vendors in your area can be sometimes difficult, especially for newbies. ClackHub therefore lists a majority\
of Vendors for different regions so you can choose the right Vendor without having to deal with possible Customs problems\
or long delivery times.
